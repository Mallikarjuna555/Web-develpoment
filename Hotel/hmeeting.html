        <p>ITC Hotels & Welcomhotels have long been renowned for magnificent gatherings of discerning people, whether corporate events or social celebrations. Conferences, symposia, board meetings, product launches and more can be hosted with great aplomb.
            There is a huge variety of spaces and hosting capacities – both indoors and outdoors – backed up by superb décor, award-winning cuisines, the latest audio-visual and technical support and business services.<br> Parties and celebrations take
            on a radiant sheen . The sheer grandeur of the hotel is the first moment of admiration . The décor, ambience and signature cuisines make the celebration ever more memorable.The warmth of intuitive service adds a special aura to the experience.<br>
            <br>The ITC Grand Chola in Chennai can host up to 3,000 guests in the Rajendra Ballroom alone. The adjoining properties in Kolkata – ITC Sonar and ITC Royal Bengal – are ideal venues for large scale events. In contrast, an offsite of 100 guests
            at Welcomhotel The Savoy in Mussoorie will be enveloped in the old world charm of a century-old property. The conference or celebration can be under the swaying palms by the sandy beaches of Welcomhotel Kences Palm Beach at Mamallapuram. At
            every hotel, the possibilities are endless and so is the exultation.</p>

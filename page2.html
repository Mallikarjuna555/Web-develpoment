    <p style="font-size: 18px;"><mark>«Good morning,</mark> little Hans,» said the Miller Good morning,» said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear. «And how have you been all the winter said the Miller. «Well. really.>> cried Hans. « it is very good of you to
        ask, very good deed my id I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing Hans said the Miller «and wonder getting on That was kind of you,» said Hanssol was half afinid you had forgotten
        me Hans. I am sum often talked of you during the winter, and the Miller, friendship never forgets That is the wonderful thing over afraid you don 't understand the poetry of life How lovely your pramnoses are looking by-the-byes They oprem lovely
        said Hans, and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so manag o bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter and buy back my wheelbarrow Wils don 't mean to say you have sold it Whe wapid thing to do! Well, the
        fact is," said Hans, that I was obliged to. You see the winter was a very had time to with. So I first sold the silver button bir Buy back your wheelbarrow? You cally had no money at all to buy bread y coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and
        then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow. But Langebu them all back again now» Hans.» said the Miller «I will give you in wheelbarrow it is not in very good repair, indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with
        the wheel-spokes. En t spite of that I will give it to you. I know it is very generous of me, and a great many would tankme extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world. I think that generosity thence of frondship
        and besides I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself. Yesu may el sour mind at ease. I will give you my wheelbarrow.» «Well, really, that is generous of you,» said little Hans, and his fulang thang face glowed all over with pleasure. «I can easily
        put it in repair, as I have a plank of the house. Aplank of wood! said the Miller: « why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn. There is very hole in it and the corn will all get damp if I don 't stop it up. How lucky you mention is
        quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another. I have given you my wheelbarrow, and nw you are to give me your plank. Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plunk but the friendship never notices things like that
        <p style="color: yellow; font-size: 18px;"> Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.» (Certainly cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out. It is not a very big plank» said the Miller, looking at it, and I am afraid that after I have
            munded my barn-roof there won 't be any felt for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault. And now as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in tutor. Here is the basket
            and mind you till it quite full» «Quite full? said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was coutea ven big basket, and he knew that if he tilled it he would have no flowers lull for the moving and he was very nxious to get his silver buttons
            back. Well, really answered the Miller, sas I have given you my w row, I don 't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers. I may be wrong bu ld have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any
            kind
